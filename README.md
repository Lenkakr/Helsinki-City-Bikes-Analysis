# Helsinki-City-Bikes-Analysis
Analysis of rides of Helsinki City Bikes in 2019 season. The challenge was to use only NumPy library for the project. This was made to challenge us to find creative solutions and experience pitfalls that working with NumPy only causes.

Amongst the results, we found out the total kilometres cycled with city bikes in 2019 season, how long the rides were on average,  the longest valid ride, the most popular station, and more.
